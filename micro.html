                        <p>Microbiology Department was started in the academic year 1999-2000<br>
                            and elevated to Post Graduate Department by offering M.Sc.,Microbiology <br>
                            in the year 2006-2007. Microbiology is the subject, which deals the <br>
                            biological activities of micro-organism. It is in great demand and <br>
                            plenty of job opportunities for the students who aspire to take up the <br>
                            job in the field of Tissue Culture, Biotechnology, Quality Control in <br>
                            Food Industries, Pollution Control, Vaccine preparation etc., Students <br>
                            have brighter chances of going to abroad, if they graduate themselves in <br>
                            this enchanting field. The well equipped laboratory in this Department have <br>
                            many advanced and costly Instruments like Laminar Air Flow systems, Binocular <br>
                            Microscopes, Deep Freezer, Autoclave, Anaerobic culture jar,Coloney counter, <br>
                            Electrophoresis system, Incubator, Hot air oven, Membrane filter, Rotary shaker, <br>
                            Spectrophotometer, UV transilluminator, High speed micro centrifuge and <br>
                            Electric saker. Students are being given ample opportunities to make use <br>
                            of these instruments and to equip themselves. Well equipped separate Laboratory<br>
                            for Molecular Biology and Immunology is also attached in this department.</p><br><br>
