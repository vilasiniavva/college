    <p>The department of Biochemistry (UG) was established in the year of 1997.<br> 
    The main objective of the Department is to inculcate the basic concepts and <br>
    application of Biochemistry in the student and to flourish in the field of <br>
    research and development. The secret of the success lies in its academic <br>
    environment and the close ties between teachers and students. Since its <br>
    very inception, the department has produced a number of bright scientists <br>
    who are now pursuing their careers in India and Abroad. The Department has <br>
    highly qualified, well experienced and dedicative faculty members. The <br>
    students of their department are exposed to highly emerging fields in their<br> 
    genomic era through the curriculum which was designed by the Board of <br>
    Biochemistry,also through various field visits and Off campus training <br>
    programmes in Hospitals as well as reputed diagnostic laboratories in the <br>
    field of Biochemistry. It is mandatory for the students to undergo laboratory <br>
    training in reputed hospitals at the end of the second year. </p>
